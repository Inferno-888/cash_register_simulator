# cash_register_simulator
This JavaScript function simulates a cash register's common operations like cash withdrawals and deposits. It also mimics real-world scenarios â€” meaning that the cash register actually has a specified amount of money in it, and a user cannot withdraw more than what's already inside the cash register!
